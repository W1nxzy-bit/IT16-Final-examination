                In developing the project, I demonstrated my web development knowledge by applying HTML and CSS. I used HTML 
                to structure the content of the website, ensuring that elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links were properly 
                organized and semantically correct. For the design and presentation, I applied CSS to style the pages, including the use of colors, 
                fonts, spacing, and layouts. I also utilized CSS properties like flexbox and alignment techniques to create a clean and responsive 
                design that adapts to different screen sizes. By combining HTML for structure and CSS for styling, 
                I was able to build a functional and visually appealing website, but sadly I encountered an issue where my video did not have audio.
